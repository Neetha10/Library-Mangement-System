# Library Management System  
A Database Design and Web Application Project. 

## Overview  
This project implements a **Library Management System (LMS)** to automate core library operations such as book rentals, room reservations, event management, and invoicing. It integrates a **normalized MySQL relational schema** with a **Node.js + Express backend** and **Firebase Authentication** for secure, role-based access.  

Key features include:  
-  Role-based access (Admin, Author, Customer, Sponsor)  
-  Book inventory management with rentals and returns  
-  Study room reservations with concurrency control  
-  Automated invoice generation via SQL triggers  
-  Event, seminar, and exhibition management  
-  Security features: SQL injection prevention, stored procedures, JWT tokens, parameterized queries, and security questions for password reset  

---

## Tech Stack  
- **Database**: MySQL (20+ normalized tables, triggers, stored procedures, indexing)  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication + JWT  
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (Studio Ghibli–themed UI)  
- **Testing & Tools**: Postman, Chart.js, Firebase Admin SDK

##  Setup Instructions  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Library-Management-System.git
cd Library-Management-System
```

### 2. Install Dependencies  
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment  
Create a `.env` file:  
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=library_db
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
```

Import `schema.sql` into MySQL to create tables, triggers, and stored procedures.  

### 4. Run the Application  
```bash
npm start
```

##  Security Highlights  
- Firebase Authentication + JWT for login/role verification  
- Parameterized queries + stored procedures to prevent SQL injection  
- Security questions for password reset with bcrypt hashing  
- Transactions with `FOR UPDATE` locks for safe concurrency  
- XSS prevention via input sanitization and safe DOM handling
